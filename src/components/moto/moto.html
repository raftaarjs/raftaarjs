    Write in plain HTML, CSS and Javascript without memorising framework concept during initial development to
    achieve fastest and best possible development experience.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The Major moto is to welcome all developers who know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and don't know a lot about
    frameworks. We are taking back to old days with a pinch of 2 way binding on the scope. Stop worrying about redundant
    declaration, writing convention and focus on what you know about basic HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since 2010 I have been working on web technologies. I started with jQuery and had no clue of core JavaScript is.
    To be honest I hated JavaScript for its condensed syntax. I was more into PHP and C# for syntax. However, purely
    working on ES6 Format made JavaScript grow on me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Initial burst on frameworks like AngularJS was a fine introduction to frontend development. With further development
    of frameworks like TypeScript based Angular, Ionic and stencils; JSX based React and Vue base VueJS,
    the competition became stiff. Moreover, the community-made noise on new technology like browser supported Web
    Components got totally ignored as ReactJS became the most dominant framework.
  </p>
  <p>
    Frontend development has diverged a lot from base HTML, CSS and JavaScript coding such that it is taking a
    mind-bending effort to reconcile the original HTML/CSS/Javascript while developing over JSX/TS/VUE. I have begun web
    development long before these frameworks began.

  <blockquote>At the end of the day, whatever advanced JS framework transpiler that you use, it
    will be ultimately be compiled in basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So why be bothered with learn transpiler's rules
    to build a website.

    The frameworks are like an additive supplement to the web development process and not the main course. However,
    the market has badly exploited them either to get major projects by wooing clients or by young developers to demand
    insane salary hikes just because they know the latest trending frameworks. Honestly, these developers have
    abandoned
    the CSS/HTML creativity and just concentrated on JS Framework inner workings (*cough* React *cough*) to crack a
    high profile interview. Whenever asked upon the native features of JavaScript, these developers are even not able to
    write a
    basic event dispatcher using Javascript.

  <h2>Preamble for developers</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>
      I want to only write the core logic for my website.
    </dt>
    <dd>
      Whatever code we write, we have to rewrite it as per the rules and regulations of the currently selected
      framework. With every iteration of the latest technology, we have to rewrite the basic logic to fit into the newly
      selected framework. Would it be incredible to just write the base logic in light DOM and the compiler takes to
      care for trending technology in frontend? YOUR CODE NEVER AGES.
    </dd>
    <dt>
      Writing HTML and CSS must be simple wherever JavaScript is not required
    </dt>
    <dt>I want Freedom from Framework Rules</dt>
    <dt>I dont want to memorize File type rules anymore</dt>
    <dt>I want Development Independent on Web Component Framework selection</dt>
       
  </dl>
  <h2>Benefits for businesses</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Reduces developer costs and Increases availability</dt>
    <dd>Availability of developers increases as the developer only has to know standard javascript feature also we
      don't have to look for developers with special skill in framework.</dd>

    <dt>Get deliverabilties in time</dt>
    <dd>Code deliverabilty becomes fast as any developer knowning javascript can jump in. There is no wait to look
      into skillset of framework.</dd>

    <dt>Delivers the best technology in the market ... Always</dt>
    <dd>Gives the fastest performance in the market due to web components and native JavaScript. No more bundle with
      framework JS. Furthermore, the compiler will always keep everything in latest technology.</dd>

    <dt>Now More upgrade to framework for same Business Logic</dt>
    <dd>The compiler is designed to adopt latest web component framework and the core logic
      is written in lightDOM format that remains ageless. In laymen terms, the logic that you wrote for your page
      would be simple (no complex scripting) and can be used any browser version (Even the old ones).</dd>

    <dt>Save development time of other developers and projects</dt>
    <dd>functions in code are portable to other framework as everything is writtern in basic javascript (The code is
      reusable to support other projects).</dd>

    <dt>Compatitbility</dt>
    <dd>It compatible on all browsers as the native support of webcomopents has begun.</dd>

    <dt>Efficient Debugging to save developers time</dt>
    <dd>debug and test in light dom and make it available in Shadow DOM for performance.</dd>

    <dt>Write less code</dt>
    <dd>Write code that is necessary. no need to repeat declaration.</dd>

    <dt>Remain Ahead in Development and deployment</dt>
    <dd>Always remain ahead in deploying due to easy development. Eject the web component code in development as it
      works too.</dd>

    <dt>Less Knowledge transfer</dt>
    <dd>We no longer need to look for a framework related developer in market. Just good Logic and javascript is
      enough.</dd>
